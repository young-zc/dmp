## 1. Getting Startï¼š

First thing that you need to do is download the necessary software.  The order suggested is because things at the top will take longer to get:

* Download and install JDK 8_151 or later available(https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/cn/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151-zhs.html).
* Download and unzip Scala 2.11.8 or later available versions(https://scala-lang.org/files/archive/nightly/) Of course, you can skip this step,Because we configured Scala's dependencies in Maven,IntelliJIdea can recognizes and uses it
* Download IntelliJ(https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), but do not install until the JDK is done installing.
* Download and install Git for Windows.  You can use this for SSH-ing as well.

## 2. Setting up IntelliJ

You can basically follow this guide, but for each section I'll document what you actually need.  If you don't care about performance just click next till you finish.

### 2.1 Select the user interface theme

* Whatever you want for this one.  Darker saves some batter I guess.

### 2.2 Download and install additional plugins

* File -> Setting -> Plugins search "Scala" install it
* If you want, you can istanll search and install "Translation".I think this is very useful.

## 3. Try to running the code

* First make sure Maven has completed the import and imported all the dependencies (this will take a long time)
* You can try to follow the actions in demo video
* If you need more help, feel free to email:newforesee@outlook.com
